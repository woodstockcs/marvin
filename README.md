# Marvin
The purpose of the Marvin system is to activate students as resources for each other. It is based on support systems used in professional engineering workplaces.

We will pilot this system for the first Reporting Period (til Sept 29), then assess its effectiveness and make a determination about whether and how it should continue.

### Signing Up
- Sign up for a day by writing your name in an empty spot on the [marvin sign-up sheet linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GWZrbq7F2G0Cmt_wIc5foC2MAJ5p8YOnbqm5ELSGDVY/edit#gid=0).
- If you will miss any part of the class you signed up for, contact Mr. Smith as soon as you know this will happen so he can put out the call for volunteer replacements.
### Expectations Before Class
- Familiarize yourself with the types of questions people have been asking by briefly reading all the issues for your language. ([scheme](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/scheme)) ([java](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/java)) ([js](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/js)) ([html-css](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/html-css))
- Get up to speed on any open issues for your block. ([e](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/block-e)) ([g](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/block-g)) ([h](https://github.com/woodstockcs/marvin/labels/block-h))
### Expectations During Class
- Your first job is to support other students. Keep an eye out for incoming `issue`s. Look available. Maybe walk around the room to see if anyone flags you down.
- Your second job is to document the support you gave, so other people can learn from it. This means you are responsible for making sure that every stuck point you help with is represented by an `issue` in github. You can ask C3PO to create the `issue` in github, or you can create it yourself.
- You are responsible for making sure every `issue` you worked on has:
  - has a title which is descriptive, and short and sweet, and
  - has the correct labels for block and language, and
  - has the student-only label if appropriate, and
  - starts with a comment which describes the symptoms of the problem.
- If it's not something you already know, then you should work together with the team to find a solution. Be sure to talk to each other while you're working.
- If you can't find a solution within a few minutes, then ask me (Mr. Smith) for support. But before you ask me make sure the `issue` is up to date in github with the info mentioned above (title, labels, comment about symptoms). I will start by reading that, then I will discuss the stuck point with you and the team, or sometimes just with you.
- When a stuck point is resolved, you are responsible for making sure the team understands the solution.
- When a stuck point is resolved, you are responsible for making sure the `issue`:
  - ends with a comment which describes the solution, and
  - is marked closed.
- If class ends and there is not solution yet, you are responsible for making sure that the next Marvin will know where to start. This means you should add a comment to any unresolved `issue`s indicating what you've already tried, any ideas about what to try next, and any other relevant comments.
- You are not responsible for adding the issues you worked on to the wiki. However you can choose to do this as a downtime activity.
- When you're not supporting other students, you should choose one of the following downtime activities to work on.
  - add an issue to the wiki (pick an issue which does )not have the `added-to-wiki` label, work to understand it, add its info to the wiki, then give that issue the `added-to-wiki` label
  - add other useful information to the wiki
  - tidy the wiki (fix typos, improve formatting, improve clarify, move more common issues to the top, etc)
  - write good questions in the testbank
### Expectations After Class
- By midnight tonight, you are responsible for tidying up the issues you worked on and giving some feedback. Use the [Marvin Checklist and Survey linked here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdgpLvzp0M2tQpytgOVt2NJkrFkybrovvsmcm-TODFwGatig/viewform?usp=sf_link).
